/**
 * @fileoverview Custom hook for automatically centering content in a PIXI viewport

 * This hook provides automatic viewport centering functionality that responds to

 * optimized bounds calculation and aspect-ratio aware positioning.

 * @param {React.RefObject} config.contentRef - Reference to content container

 * @description
 * Key improvements in this version:
 * - Uses getLocalBounds() for stability (not affected by world transforms)
 * - Stable X positioning using container coordinates
 * - Aspect-ratio aware Y positioning (20% from top instead of center)
 * - Comprehensive safety checks to prevent runtime errors
 * - requestAnimationFrame optimization for smooth performance

 * useAutoRecenter({

       * Core principle:
       * - X positioning prevents text alignment drift
       * - Y positioning handled entirely by useResponsiveTextPosition 
       * - Camera NEVER adjusts Y axis - only X centering
       * - No camera-induced vertical movement during control changes
       * 
       * Benefits for learning:
       * ✅ Zero Y distractions while mastering X alignment concepts
       * ✅ Clean separation: content positioning vs camera centering
       * ✅ Predictable behavior: only X axis responds to alignment changes
       * ✅ Pure focus on anchor point vs container position concepts
